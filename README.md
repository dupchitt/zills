# zills
Python playground for music analysis and classification. Focus on middle eastern percussions.

Initiating work. Be carefull and keep a safety helmet. 

## Requirements:
- Python 3
- numpy, librosa
- scikit-learn


 ## Goals
 
 Towards predicting category of middle eastern music, and labelling rythms inside the track.

### Music analysis 101: Let's start it small
- musical format conversion
- pre-processing of audio track : normalization, trim, foreground extraction etc.
- Analysis and features extraction of one track
- Visualization of results for several tracks


### Then time to think in larger dimensions
- creation of a database or processing of existing ones (web queries etc.)
- Big data analysis (haddop/spark ?)
- Machine learning / deep learning classification
- UI for users to feed with their own tracks


### IRL skills:
- improving at musical theory, drum and zils rythms recognition and practice
